BBPower - the C_ell-based pipeline for BB
-----------------------------------------

This repo hosts a pipeline that carries out a maps-to-params analysis of multi-frequency polarization data to constrain primordial B-modes using a power-spectrum-based component separation scheme. The pipeline is built following the BBPipe framework. [BBPipe](https://github.com/simonsobs/BBPipe) is a pipeline constructor used to connect different pipeline stages in terms of their outputs and required inputs, and it's one of BBPower's dependencies.
